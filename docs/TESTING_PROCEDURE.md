## Engine Diagnosis Procedure

1. **Warm Up Engine**: 
   - Operate engine at idle (800-1000 RPM) for 5 minutes

2. **Steady-State Testing**:
   - 1500 RPM: Hold for 2 minutes (Check for valve train noise)
   - 2500 RPM: Hold for 1 minute (Detect piston slap)
   - 3000 RPM: Hold for 30 seconds (Identify detonation)

3. **Dynamic Testing**:
   - Rapid acceleration from 1000-4000 RPM
   - Deceleration from 4000-1500 RPM

4. **Load Testing** (if possible):
   - Perform under vehicle load (dyno or road test)
